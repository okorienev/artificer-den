### What's this guide about?
This guide is about a relatively easy way of making your local foundry available for your players world-wide without messing with your home network setup/creating virtual local networks etc.

This guide assumes that your local foundry is up and running, and you are able to access it without any issues.
In case if you haven't set up foundry, please follow [Foundry Installation Guide](https://foundryvtt.com/article/installation/) first


### Let's install & setup ngrok

* Navigate to [ngrok website](https://ngrok.com/)

* Sign up or Log in using preferable method

* You'll end up in the dashboard section with installation options for your operating system (Windows in my case)

* Install ngrok

* To make ngrok work on Windows (macOS & Linux installations steps are easier):

    * Download the ngrok executable [from ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup/windows)

    * Unpack it to the directory you like (`D:\programs\ngrok` in my case)

    * Add directory you've unpacked ngrok to `Path` environment variable
        - you can use [This guide](https://pureinfotech.com/create-custom-environment-variables-windows-10/) or any other to find the environment variables
        - In my case Path looks like this:

![Environment variables]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ugc/2023-12-30-running-local-foundry-with-ngrok/environment.png)

* To check that ngrok works, open terminal `cmd.exe` (for Windows) and type `ngrok -v`, it should return version of installed ngrok agent

* Navigate to [Getting Started -> Your Auth token](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) in the ngrok dashboard

* Copy the auth command & run it in terminal

![Auth command location]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ugc/2023-12-30-running-local-foundry-with-ngrok/auth.png)

* Run Foundry VTT

* Run `ngrok http 30000`, you should see the following interface:

![Ngrok interface]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ugc/2023-12-30-running-local-foundry-with-ngrok/ngrok.png)

* Share highlighted link with your players, be cautious because it changes between ngrok runs

* you could create static domain (but on the free tier ngrok will still pick a name itself):

    * Navigate to [Ngrok domains](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/cloud-edge/domains)
  
    * Click `Create Domain`

    * Your command now will look like `ngrok http --domain=<autogenerated-domain>.ngrok-free.app 30000`
